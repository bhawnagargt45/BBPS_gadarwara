<H2><B>WHAT WORLD MIGHT BE IN 2050?</B></H2>

<H3>In 2050, our life will be a lot different from nowadays in many aspects. The environment, transportation, education and people’s
 lifestyles will also change to a new level. There are some reasons to be optimistic about life then. Along with development of 
scientific advances, people will have more means of transport. Solar- powered, wind- powered cars which are much more 
environment-friendly will be produced and used. Travelling to other planets will be more available for everyone.
And with the help of technologies, we don’t need to go to school anymore. Just stay at home and you can learn everything with online
 teachers. The schedule will be more optional for you to choose as long as it suits your time and your purposes. However, there also
 some reasons to worry about life in the year 2050. The more modern the technologies will be the much polluted environment we have.</H3>

<H3>There will be robots helping people in many aspects of their lives. People won’t need to do housework or cook for meals because
 robots do them all. Because we can study at home so people will use computers almost every day, which make they become much
 lazier and easier to be fat. There will have a lot of changes in our life in the next 37 years.
The world in which I live in the year 2050 is only marginally different than the one we lived in fifty years ago. Communication
 technology at this point is really the only thing that has advanced in great leaps.

Seven billion people will live in urban areas by 2050; vastly outnumbering rural people. There will be more senior citizens than young
 people (between the ages of 12 and 17) and children (people under the age of 12).</H3>
