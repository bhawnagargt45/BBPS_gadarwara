<H3>humanity's future in space reaches far beyond that and could include missions to Mars, the outer solar system, and telescopes
 observing the earliest moments of the universe.</H3>
<H3><P>Exploration will also be mirrored in terms of commercial exploitation and (perhaps) even the creation of settlements on other
 planets.
<P>1. Between the Moon, Mars, the main asteroid belt, and the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, there are many 
tantalizing locations where humans could establish self-sustaining cities that would allow for further expansion and exploration.</P>


<BR><P>2.Mars will be a major focal point for space agencies over the next three decades. In addition to increased robotic exploration, three
 major space agencies are planning to send astronauts to Mars between the 2030s and 2050s.</P>


<BR><P>3. NASA is expected to lead the way with its "Moon to Mars" program, which will build on Project Artemis, the Lunar Gateway, and other key components.</P>
 <P> the Chinese National Space Agency (CNSA) have announced similar plans to send crews to Mars by way of the Moon.</P>

<BR><P>4. While not a lot of details have been forthcoming, Roscosmos has stated that such a mission would likely happen in the 2040-2045
 timeframe.</P>

<BR><P>5.China, meanwhile, emphasizes that it plans to send robotic missions to Mars well into the 2050s, followed by the first crewed
 missions between 2040 and 2050.</P></H3>

<BR><P><H3>6. Anti and microgravity enable astronauts to execute medical research that is impossible to perform on earth. For example,
 NASA's research on new treatment options for complex diseases, such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, require the use of a
 microgravity environment to allow the microparticles in the treatment solution to stay robust.</H3></P>

Both space agencies conducted training exercises - the Mars500 simulations - between 2007 and 2011
 to see how astronauts would contend with the long-term isolation that such missions would entail.
<H3><P> 
Elon Musk has also been quite vocal about his plans to send humans to Mars during the 2020s. It was for this purpose that he founded
 SpaceX in 2001 and has been working towards the realization of the Starship super-heavy flight system. Initially, this system was
 known as the Mars Colonial Transporter, which reflected its ultimate purpose.</P>
</H3>
<H1><B>“China and Russia have signed the international memorandum of understanding, but if they explore the Moon separately from others
 I think it will be good to have the competition.”</B></H1>

<H3><P>By the year 2050, humans will have established a permanent presence on the Moon and a research base on Mars, while space travel will
 become a regular occurrence for many people. And the climate crisis could be partly addressed by the use of enormous solar shades
 in space that could help to protect us from the worst warming effects of the sun.</P></H3>

<H3><p> Currently, NASA's research at the ISS includes biomedical research, material science,
 technology advancement, and methods to enable further space exploration.</p></H3>

<H3>The unique attributes of space enable astronauts to conduct research that could not otherwise be executed on earth. Furthermore, 
the unrepeated perspective from space looking at earth enables scientists to gain more insight on the earth's natural environment. 
Research conducted at the International Space Station aims to benefit human civilizations on earth and extend human knowledge 
around space and space exploration.</H3>
<H3><p> NASA has also reported research
 investment in microbial vaccine development and microencapsulation of drugs for targeted and more efficient treatment delivery.
