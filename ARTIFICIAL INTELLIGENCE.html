<H3><BR><P>1.Global electricity generation will increase between 123% and 150% by 2050. Global electricity generation will increase
 between now and 2050: In 2010, global electricity production was 21.5 billion MWh globally. In Jazz, this is expected 
to increase by 150% to 53.6 billion MWh by 2050.</P>
<BR><P>2.Although petroleum and other liquid fuels will remain the world's largest energy source in 2050, renewable energy sources,
 which include solar and wind, will grow to nearly the same level.</P>
<BR><P>3.Demand for electricity will grow twice as fast as that for transport. China and India will account for 71 percent of new capacity.
 By 2050, electricity will account for a quarter of all energy demand, compared with 18 percent now. How will that additional
 power be generated? More than three-quarters of new capacity (77 percent), according to the McKinsey research, will come from 
wind and solar, 13 percent from natural gas, and the rest from everything else.</P>
<BR><P>4.The share of nuclear and hydro is also expected to grow, albeit modestly.</P>
<BR><P>5.What that means is that by 2050, nonhydro renewables will account for more than a third of global power generation—a huge
 increase from the 2014 level of 6 percent. To put it another way, between now and 2050, wind and solar are expected to 
grow four to five times faster than every other source of power.</P>
<BR><P>6.Fossil fuels will dominate energy use through 2050. This is because of the massive investments that have already been made and
 because of the superior energy intensity and reliability of fossil fuels.</P>

<HR><H3><BR><P>1.The hyperloop concept involves passenger pods travelling through pressurised tubes using an electric propulsion and magnetic
 levitation. ... With many countries such as the UK, Japan and China pledging to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, Hyperloop travel
 offers a feasible alternative to domestic air travel.</P>
<BR><P>2.In 50 years, electric vehicles will outnumber gas-powered, which have been outlawed from city limits due to global warming. Because
 of new breakthroughs in making cars more intelligent, lighter and stronger, more people are choosing to commute longer distances than
 ever before.</P>
<BR><P>3.In India, Maharashtra has deemed hyperloop a public infrastructure exercise and approved the Virgin Hyperloop-DP World consortium as
 the original project proponent for the Mumbai Pune hyperloop project.</P>
<BR><P>4.It's 3 1/2 times faster than Japan's Shinkansen bullet trains and even faster than a Boeing 747. It's a hyperloop – magnetic pods
 levitating inside a tube at more than 1,000 kilometers per hour. In theory, you could go from LA to San Francisco in just 45 minutes
 with tickets less than $100 one way.</P>
<BR><P>5.he concept gained popularity in 2013 when Elon Musk wrote his Hyperloop Alpha paper. And in November 2020, Virgin Hyperloop 
demonstrated its first passenger test ride.</P>
<BR><P>6.Virgin Hyperloop and Hyperloop Transportation Technologies are working to bring hyperloop into a reality by 2050.
This is the future of high-speed transportation. It's 3 1/2 times faster than Japan's Shinkansen bullet trains and even faster than
 a Boeing 747.</P></H3>

<HR><H3><BR><P>1.Robots will be commonplace in our homes by 2050 - with 'android rights' such as being treated with respect, an expert has predicted.
 The machines may even have to be PAID for their services, as artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly advanced, Dr Ian
 Pearson says.But sensor technology, speech recognition, information searches and so forth are advancing apace.</P>
<BR><P.2. They won't just take over manual work, indeed plumbing and gardening will be among the hardest jobs to automate, but routine legal
 work (conveyancing and suchlike), medical diagnostics and even surgery.</P>
<BR><P>3.In the year 2050, technology will dominate the workplace with artificial intelligence and smart assistants being commonplace,
 while the use of augmented and virtual reality continues to increase. Everything will be 'smart' – connected and data-driven.
Predicted by: Ian Pearson.</P>
<BR><P>4. Ian has been a full-time futurologist for over 25 years, tracking and predicting developments across a wide range of technology,
 business, society, politics and the environment.We see a picket line of robots in the city center.</P>
<BR.<P>5. Their placards are plastered with slogans written in binary code. The widespread development of robots and artificial intelligencE
 have necessitated the creation of a legal framework to protect them to regulate the rights of intelligent robots.</P>
 Subsequently, this code is constantly updated and improved so robots have improving rights in our society.
<BR><P>6.Robot In 2050, our planet will be the vast lead in life for example the robots will take place of our cashiers, the buses will
 drive by their self  ,payment methods will be totally change you can say it the utter era of that century.The single press of 
voice command you house will operate your lights your hanging dresses even many more.,/P>

<BR><P>1.A new World Bank Group report, "Minerals for Climate Action: "The Mineral Intensity of the Clean Energy Transition," 
finds that the production of minerals, such as graphite, lithium and cobalt, could increase by nearly 500% by 2050, to meet the
 growing demand for clean energy technologies.</P>
<H2>Is mining good for the economy?</H2>
<H3><BR><P>2.In addition, mining is economically important to producing regions and countries. It provides employment, dividends, and taxes that
 pay for hospitals, schools, and public facilities. ... The economic opportunities and wealth generated by mining for many producing 
countries are substantial.</P>
2.<BR><P>ithium: Demand to rise rapidly, from 313 kt of lithium carbonate equivalent in 2019 to 1,465 kt by 2050. Thermal coal: Demand for
 imported coal to increase 23.5 per cent, from 947 Mt in 2019 to 1170 Mt in 2050. Uranium: Global uranium demand to rise steadily,
 from 79.7 kt in 2019 to 99.5 kt in 2050.</P>
<BR><P>3.Critical minerals are mineral resources that are essential to the economy and whose supply may be disrupted. ... Today, many critical
 minerals are metals that are central to high-tech sectors. They include the rare earth elements and other metals such as lithium,
 indium, tellurium, gallium, and platinum group elements.Mining and metals are essential to the global economy and
societal development. </P>
<BR><P>4.Standing at the beginning of mosTvalue chains, the sector is a critical supplier of essentialmaterials anD
 products and a global generator of trade,employment and economic development.To be essential is not, however, to be immune from pressure
or criticism.</P>
<BR><P>5. The mining and metals sector faces significaNt demands and expectations from across the value chain and
stakeholder groups – from shareholders and customers, togovernments, communities and consumers. In a constantly
changing world, global disruptions and transformationstowards a more sustainable and equitable future are
challenging the traditional way of doing business.</P>
<BR><P>6.Sustainable development is a well-documented challenge for the planet in the years leading up to 2050, and beyond.More recently,
 2015 has been a critical year as the world convenes to collectively agree on pathways forwardon goals for sustainable developmenT
 (UN Summit on Sustainable Development Goals),and on climate change (UN climate change conference).1It is estimated that between now and 2050 the world’s
population will grow from just over 7 billion to 9.6 billion,2along with further growth in consumption per capita.</P>

<HR><H3><BR><P>1.On 14 May 2018, the United States Census Bureau calculated the world population as 7,472,985,269 for that same date
 and the United Nations estimated over 7 billion. In 2017, the United Nations increased the medium variant projections to
 9.8 billion for 2050 and 11.2 billion for 2100.</P>
<BR><P>2.he new projections include some notable findings at the country level. China (with 1.4 billion inhabitants) and India (1.3 billion inhabitants) remain the two most populous countries, comprising 19 and
 18% of the total global population.  the population of Nigeria, currently the world’s 7th largest, is projected to surpass that of
 the United States and become the third largest country in the world shortly before 2050.</P>
<BR><P>3.From 2017 to 2050, it is expected that half of the world’s population growth will be concentrated in just
 nine countries: India, Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Pakistan, Ethiopia, the United Republic of Tanzania, the 
United States of America, Uganda and Indonesia (ordered by their expected contribution to total growth).</P>

<BR><P> 4. As a result, the population of these countries has been growing rapidly, at around 2.4 % per year.
 Although this rate of increase is expected to slow significantly over the coming decades, the combined population of the LDCs,
 roughly one billion in 2017, is projected to increase by 33 % between 2017 and 2030, and to reach 1.9 billion persons in 2050.</P>

<BR><P>5. reduce inequality and ensure that no one is left behind.
The report highlights that a reduction in the fertility level results not only in a slower pace of population growth but also in an
 older population.</P>

<BR><P>6.In Europe, 25% of the population is already aged 60 years or over. That proportion is projected to reach 35% in 2050 and to remain 
around that level in the second half of the century. Populations in other regions are also projected to age significantly over the
 next several decades and continuing through 2100.</P>
